crime will be reduced to 50,000 Euros, and will be standardised with those
applied in respect of fraud committed against European Union and Social Security
budgets. To this end, we will lengthen the statute of limitations to ten years
and will implement the penalties currently applied to the aggravated type
whenever the defrauded amount goes over 120,000 Euros." />
