	<meta property="og:description" content="We will reform the Law on Public Sector Contracts in order:

 * To establish a network of central purchasing offices for the unification of
   contracting procedures.
 * To implement a single information platform about public contracts.
 * Create Central Administrative Courts, as the bodies responsible for the
   centralized resolution of contractual resources.
 * To remove unpublicized negotiated procedures and limit the amount that
   permits the use of smaller contract.
 * To reform the trade register website to make basic company information freely
   available and easy to consult
 * To bring into focus social, environmental and local economy criteria to bring
   contract conditions in line with these specifications, and with citizen
   participation." />
